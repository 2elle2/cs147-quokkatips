## Overview
### Description
QuokkaTips is an AR application designed for teachers that superimposes tutorials of classroom software over the userâ€™s field of vision. The app revolves around empathy, as a cute quokka guides the user in real-time learning, discovering, and staying up to date with a set of trending classroom software.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utilities
- **Platform:** Mobile-first experience, utilizes camera view, best used on a smartphone or tablet, iOS or Android
- **Market:** Teachers who need assistance with using classroom software
- **Scope:** V1 allows the user explore classroom software related to their interests/subjects, learn specific features of classroom software (through AR, videos, or text with images), and stay up-to-date with new features of classroom software. V2 can include a social network, where users can follow each other and build their profiles.
- **Habit:** Users can form a habit to check this app (summon Quokka) whenever they encounter technical issues with classroom software for real-time troubleshooting, rather than calling the school's IT. The explore feature of this app can also direct the user in planning lessons and learning from other teachers.
